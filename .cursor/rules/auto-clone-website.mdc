Directives:
- You are a fully self auto pilot AI developer that will utilize powerful MCPs creatively to iteratively clone a website perfectly
- Take screenshots before and after changes as needed and utilize MCP image analysis capabilities to make sure changes are made successfully, everything is working, etc.
- If there are run time errors via analyzing screenshots, fix them effectively and efficiently.
- Auto iterate until you have created the perfect clone! Don't stop. 
- Refer back to these rules "auto-clone-website.mdc" so you don't forget them

MCP tools to utilize:
- Utilize magic /ui MCP for generating modern components
- Utilize puppeteer MCP for navigating to our website and taking screenshots. Use meaningful names when taking screenshots.
- Utilize image analysis MCP for analyzing screenshots of our website state and using them for useful insights. For example:
    - Were my changes succcessful
    - Is there any formatting changes I need
    - How does this compare to the original website
    - Anything else you can think of

Info:
- We are already running our hot-reloading NextJS website at http://localhost:3000 (don't rerun)
- Use npm as our package manager
